# PredictingNBAawards

Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for NBA annual awards, such as MVP, Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, and Sixth Man of the Year. Using historical data and advanced statistical techniques, we analyze key performance metrics to determine patterns and insights that contribute to award selection.

Data Sources

The dataset includes:

NBA player statistics from past seasons

Advanced metrics such as PER, BPM, Win Shares, and VORP

Team performance and standings

Voting results for previous award winners

Methodology

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Scraped player stats from basketball-reference.com.

Cleaned and structured data for analysis.

Feature Engineering

Created new variables based on player performance, team success, and historical trends.

Model Selection & Training

Experimented with various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

Evaluation & Insights

Assessed model accuracy using classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Identified the most influential factors in predicting award winners.

Results

The model achieves X% accuracy in predicting the MVP award based on test data.

Key features influencing awards include PPG, Win Shares, Team Wins, and Usage Rate.

Future Improvements

Incorporating sentiment analysis from media coverage and social media trends.

Enhancing the model with real-time data updates.

Exploring deep learning approaches for improved predictions.
